“The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data” – at
least that’s how *The Economist* phrased it in an article in 2017
([*1*](#ref-economist2017)). But is that true? There are certainly good
reasons to support this metaphor. Much like oil, data can also be seen
as a raw material – and as a raw material they are worthless unless
processed.

However, there is the argument that data could be viewed more like an
infrastructure than oil in the sense that it provides the fundamental
framework or system needed for things to function. This could be in the
context of operations, processes or even economies. Data, like
infrastructure, is essential for information flow, decision making, and
overall functioning in today’s digital era. And, unlike oil, which is
consumed and needs to be replenished, data can be used repeatedly.
Seeing data as a sort of infrastructure is used as an argument that its
publication should be a responsibility of the state — in the form of
open government data ([*2*](#ref-fedlex2018)).

Open government data (OGD) refers to the idea that data collected and
generated by government entities should be freely accessible to the
public, excluding information that compromises privacy and security.
This type of data is often used as a means to promote transparency and
accountability in government, enable public participation, and drive
economic growth through the development of new apps, products, and
services. It also offers potential for innovation by providing raw
material for research, as well as the basis for planning in areas like
transport, healthcare, or environmental policy.

# Some principles behind OGD

## The FAIR principle

OGD should be FAIR. The latter stands for **F**indability,
**A**ccessibility, **I**nteroperability, and **R**euse. *Findability*
means that data have a unique and persistent identification. For
example, personal data should be given identification numbers (ID) that
can be uniquely assigned to individuals. Furthermore, datasets should be
described with *metadata*. *Accessibility* refers to the principle that
data are freely available via a URL. If data is protected, then at least
their metadata should be published. *Interoperability* refers to the
publication of data and metadata in a known (and widespread) format.
Lastly, by *Reuse*, we mean that the provenance of data is indicated,
the data is always provided with data usage license and is retrievable
in a sensible size.

## The five-star system

Not all open data are of the same quality – *all OGD are open, but some
are more open than others*. In 2010, Sir Tim Berners-Lee suggested a
5-star ranking for open data. The data get more stars as proprietary
formats are removed and links are added ([table 1](#tbl-stars)).

<div id="tbl-stars">

|                       Stars | Idea                                                                                | Example format       |
|----------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------|
|                     $\star$ | Make your stuff available on the web under an open license (no matter the format).   | `PDF`                |
|                $\star\star$ | Make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan of a table). | `XLS`                |
|           $\star\star\star$ | Make it available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel).     | `CSV`, `JSON`, `XML` |
|      $\star\star\star\star$ | Use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff.                   | `RDF`                |
| $\star\star\star\star\star$ | Link your data to other data to provide context.                                     | `LOD`                |

Table 1: The five-star system according to Tim Berners-Lee. The more
stars, the more *open* the published data is.

## Open standards

For data to be truly open, it is not enough that it is accessible. The
format also needs to follow an *open standard*, that is, a standard that
is widely used, internationally accepted, consensus-based, in the public
domain and clearly defined. Importantly, metadata, i.e., data about the
data, should also follow that open standard. Examples of that are
*Dublin Core*, *Schema.org*, or *DCAT*.

## Interoperability

Interoperability is the ability of independent, heterogeneous computer
systems to work together as seamlessly as possible in order to exchange
information in an efficient and usable manner, and to make it available
to the user without the need for special agreements between the systems.
For this, compliance with common standards is necessary.

# Data owner, custodian and steward

The roles of data owners, data custodians, and data stewards, all play
critical parts in the management and governance of data, but their
responsibilities are distinct:

1.  **Data Owner:** This is usually a member of management who has legal
    authority and control over some data. They are responsible for the
    security and quality of the data and for determining who should have
    access to the information. They must also ensure compliance with
    relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

2.  **Data Custodian:** The data custodian is typically responsible for
    the technical environment and operations needed to protect and
    maintain data. These responsibilities may include data storage,
    retrieval, archival, or purging. The data custodian ensures data is
    managed and protected, execute the access decisions made by the data
    owner, and maintain the data’s technical infrastructure.

3.  **Data Steward:** The data steward ensures the quality and usability
    of the data. They concern themselves with data standards, data
    definitions, data quality metrics, and business metadata. They serve
    as a bridge between data owners (who decide the policies) and data
    custodians (who implement the policies) by making sure that data is
    reliable, understood, and used correctly
    ([*3*](#ref-plotkin2020data)).

# The Swiss OGD ecosystem

Switzerland passed the Freedom of Information Act and Regulation
(*Öffentlichkeitsgesetz, Öffentlichkeitsverordnung*) on July 1, 2006.
These laws state, that anybody has the right to get access to
non-protected governmental documents ([*4*](#ref-fedlex2004)). Although
that was a first step towards a more transparent government, it’s not
open government data. The [parliamentary group for digital
sustainability](https://www.parldigi.ch) (Parldigi), founded in 2009, is
concerned with promoting concepts such as open source software, open
standards, open data, open access, open content, open internet, open
government in parliament. Outside of parliament, the association
[opendata.ch](https://opendata.ch/), founded in 2011, has been committed
to strengthening transparency, participation and innovation in
Switzerland with respect to data.

The legal framework around OGD recently experienced renewal with the OGD
strategy Switzerland 2019-2023 ([*2*](#ref-fedlex2018)). This strategy
creates a business office OGD within the federal statistical office
responsible with its implementation. Goal is the targeted publication of
government data at a high quality. For this purpose, the meta data
platform [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss) is created. Supporting
that strategy, the federal law on the use of electronic means for the
fulfillment of official duties (EMBAG), which is expected to come into
effect in the beginning of 2024, will force all governmental software
and data to be published *by default* ([*5*](#ref-fedlex2023)).
Specifically, the law states:

> **Art. 10** Open Government Data
>
> <sup>1</sup> *Die diesem Gesetz unterstehenden Verwaltungseinheiten
> machen ihre Daten, die sie zur Erfüllung ihrer gesetzlichen Aufgaben
> beschaffen oder generieren und die elektronisch gespeichert und in
> Sammlungen strukturiert vorliegen, öffentlich zugänglich.*

However, there are many exceptions to that law, such that finding
excuses not to publish data for governmental bodies will remain
relatively easy. In addition, the data protection act states that for
the publication of *personal data*, i.e., data referring to any legal
entity, a special legal basis is required – thus, personal data are
specifically exempt from the EMBAG ([*6*](#ref-fedlex2023dsg)).

## How to anonymize personal data

Personal data may only be published if it is anonymized. One such method
for anonymization is $k$-anonymity. Its protocol was developed in 1998
by Samarati and Sweeney ([*7*](#ref-samarati1998protecting)). The
(basic) algorithm to determine the degree of anonymity $k$ of some
personal data is relatively simple. In R, it could be written as
follows:

``` r
K <- numeric(nrow(D))
for (i in 1:nrow(D)) {
   for (j in 1:nrow(D)) {
      if(i==j) next
      if(all(D[i,qi]==D[j,qi])) K[j] <- K[j]+1
   }
}
k <- min(K)
```

Here, `K` is the number of identical entries found for an observation in
the data set `D`, while `k` is the minimum of vector `K`. The vector
`qi` contains variable names of the quasi-identifiers. Standard personal
data should only be published when $k \geq 20$, and sensitive personal
data only if $k \geq 50$.

# The impact of open government data

Open government data can have all sorts of benefits. This includes (but
is not limited to) the following:

1.  **Transparency:** Open government data allows for greater
    transparency in public administration. It enables citizens to see
    what decisions are being made and how resources are being allocated.
    This may build trust, as citizens can see the rationale behind
    policies and decisions, and helps to hold government officials
    accountable.

2.  **Innovation:** Open data can be used by individuals or
    organizations to create innovative solutions and services. As such,
    it can foster entrepreneurship and stimulate economic growth.

3.  **Sustainability:** Open government data can be useful in academic
    research, and may be used as a resource in education, both for
    teaching and learning. Students can analyze real data for projects
    or assignments. It also encourages citizen participation and
    engagement in government processes by enabling more informed
    discussions and debates.

4.  **Efficiency:** Open data fosters collaboration between different
    government entities, as well as between governments and citizens,
    nonprofits, businesses, etc. This can generally lead to a more
    efficient and attractive government administration.

This all sounds great. However, individual governmental bodies need to
know what their specific goals are, i.e., why they are publishing data.
And ideally, they should (quantitatively) measure the impact in that
regard, for example by applying the social return on investment approach
([*8*](#ref-stuermer2016measuring)). Unfortunately, determining causal
effects like this is very difficult. It might be much more
straightforward to pose surrogate questions: What businesses rely on the
open data? How many research papers were published using the data? How
often was the data used by journalists? Did the transparency lead to any
citizen participation? So really, we are interested in the
intermediaries, the entities using the open data, rather than their
final effects.

# Conclusion

Open government data represents a significant opportunity to foster
transparency, accountability, innovation and citizen participation in
governance. It also bolsters economic growth and encourages data-driven
policy making. In Switzerland, laws start to come into effect that
specifically promote open government data. However, for OGD to be truly
open (in spirit), some concepts such as FAIR, the five-star system,
interoperability and open standards need to be followed. Also, it’s
crucial for governments to clearly define their OGD goals and assess
their impact, ensuring that the data is effectively serving its intended
purpose and benefiting society.
